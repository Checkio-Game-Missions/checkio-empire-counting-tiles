Each square tile has size of 1x1 meters. 
You need to calculate how many whole and partial tiles are needed for a circle with a radius of N meters. 
The center of the circle will be at the intersection of four tiles. For example: a circle with a radius of 2 metres
requires 4 whole tiles and 12 partial tiles.
